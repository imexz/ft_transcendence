When in Game: paddleButton in UserSummery is clickable

Reload when invited and accepted a game

x invites y, z invites x, y denies -> x plays vs z 
viewRequest: when user in game and tries to invite/view game of third user ->cannot read undefined 
Reload during game with playerleft: doesnt render current game 
When invited, inviting the other player back should not be possible 
leaveGame: remove Spectators in gameService.spectatorsMap 
joinAndCreateGame function: x goes to queue, y invites x -> close searchbar
