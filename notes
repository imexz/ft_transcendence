Topics:



When invited, inviting the other player back should not be possible

joinAndCreateGame function: x goes to queue, y invites x --> frontend bug

Spectator: Winning Screen shows "askForRematch" Button

Search for player y, log out player y, invite player y to a match --> starts game...

Change hitbox of paddles / collision control
Limit serving angle

Ideas:
    do not change view when adding user as friend

Done:
<!-- After Game: invite winner to game (even if its the same person) -->
<!-- spectating a game via paddleIcon leads to range error -->
<!-- autoselect form field when clicking on search icon -->
<!-- When in Game: paddleButton in UserSummery is clickable -->
<!-- No invites from User currently playing -->
<!-- Reload when invited and accepted a game -->
<!-- x invites y, z invites x -> game starts for x and y, z spectates -->
<!-- x invites y, z invites x, y denies -> x plays vs z -->
<!-- viewRequest: when user in game and tries to invite/view game of third user ->cannot read undefined -->
